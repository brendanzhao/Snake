Snake
=========

This is the classic Snake game I've decided to recreate during my spare time.<br />
This game is very basic.<br />

Refactor TODO:<br />
Change the snake to be stored within a linked list instead of an array.<br />
When a food block is eaten, add a new block to the end of the snake instead of replacing the food block as a new head.<br />
Remove direction enumeration to simplify code with a simple x and y direction variable to be set at -1, 0, 1.

Features TODO:<br />
Pause functionality.<br />
End game Functionality.<br />
Add obstacles.<br />
Place food blocks in harder to reach places based on difficulty.<br />
Better graphics.
Add power-ups.
