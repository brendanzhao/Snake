Snake
=========

This is the classic Snake game I've decided to recreate during my spare time for fun.<br />
The MSDN style commenting is unncessary however I felt like complying with all StyleCop formatting for this project.<br />

Refactor TODO:<br />
When a food block is eaten, add a new block to the end of the snake instead of replacing the food block as a new head.<br />
Remove Direction enumeration to simplify code with a simple x and y direction variable to be set at -1, 0, 1.

Features TODO:<br />
Pause functionality.<br />
End game Functionality.<br />
Add obstacles.<br />
Place food blocks in harder to reach places based on difficulty.<br />
Better graphics.<br />
Add power-ups.

Bugs TODO:<br />
The Snake is able to move backwards and thus through itself when moving very slowly.
