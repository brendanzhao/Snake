##Snake

####About
This is the classic Snake game I've decided to recreate during my spare time for fun. When you run the game, use the keyboard arrow keys to move the snake. Goodluck!<br />
The code follows all StyleCop formatting standards.

####Features
There are four playable difficulties currently in the game of which only the speed currently is changed between difficulties.<br />
