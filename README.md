Snake
=========

This is the classic Snake game I've decided to recreate during my spare time for fun.<br />
The MSDN style commenting is unncessary however I felt like complying with all StyleCop formatting for this project.<br />

Refactor TODO:<br />
Move code out of some event handlers and into their own methods.

Features TODO:<br />
Pause functionality.<br />
End game Functionality.<br />
Add obstacles.<br />
Place food blocks in harder to reach places based on difficulty.<br />
Better graphics.<br />
Add power-ups.

Bugs TODO:<br />
There is a possibility of the food block being drawn ontop of the snake. However it's very unlikely.
