###About
This is the classic Snake game I've decided to recreate during my spare time for fun. When you run the game, use the keyboard arrow keys to move the snake and press space to pause. Goodluck!<br />
The code follows all StyleCop formatting standards.

###Features
There are four playable difficulties which determine how fast the snake will move.<br />
If you do not like the default playing grid size, you can resize the application before clicking the "Start Game" button and the bounds will automatically update.<br />
You can pause the game by pressing the space bar.<br />
There is an option to restart the game if the game ends.
